## Real-world use case: ONLYOFFICE Docs & Pipedrive integration

This section details how the AI Auto Fill plugin can be used to automatically populate ONLYOFFICE PDF forms with data from Pipedrive.

### Connecting and configuring the plugin

* Navigate to the [ONLYOFFICE app](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-pipedrive) settings within Pipedrive.
* Locate and enable the corresponding checkbox.

The configuration settings for the AI Auto Fill plugin are inherited from the main [AI plugin](https://www.onlyoffice.com/app-directory/ai) in ONLYOFFICE Docs. To learn how to install and connect various AI models, please refer to the [relevant documentation](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/docs/userguides/ai/configuration.aspx).

### How the value matching works

The plugin intelligently matches Pipedrive data with the fields in your ONLYOFFICE PDF form without sending sensitive user data to the AI.

1. **Data request:** The plugin requests available data from Pipedrive. It can retrieve information related to customers, sellers, deals, organizations, and products.
2. **Field analysis:** It then retrieves the key data (or tag) for all fields within the PDF form.
3. **AI-powered matching:** The plugin sends only the data keys and field keys to the AI model. The AI then determines the best matches between Pipedrive data points and your form fields.
4. **Recommendations:** Finally, the plugin displays the AI's recommendations for you to review and apply.

### Usage

**1. Opening a PDF form**

To begin, open a PDF form within Pipedrive from the ONLYOFFICE Documents section.

Please note: It's important that a PDF form must be created in ONLYOFFICE.

**2. Initiating autofill**

When the editor opens, the AI Auto Fill plugin will appear automatically on the side panel.

To proceed with populating the form, click the Autofill button. If you prefer to fill the form manually, simply click Cancel or close the plugin panel.

**3. Reviewing suggestions**

After clicking Autofill, a new window will open, displaying each form field alongside the corresponding value suggested by the AI.

* If the AI identifies multiple potential values for a single field, you can choose the correct one from a drop-down list.
* To skip filling a specific field, uncheck the checkbox next to it.
* To locate a field within the document, click the Open file location button next to it.

**4. Applying the data**

Once you have reviewed the suggestions, click the Apply button. A confirmation prompt will appear, warning you that the form fields will be filled automatically. If you confirm, the selected values will be inserted into the form.

**5. Post-fill options**

After the process completes, the plugin will display a success message.

The Cancel autofill button will become active, allowing you to undo the changes and revert the form to its previous state.

If you have closed the plugin at any point, you can always reopen it from the Plugins tab in the top toolbar of the editor.
